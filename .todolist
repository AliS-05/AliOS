0. possible C++ rewrite ? (dont see a real need but claude keeps recommending it so maybe ? prob keep what i have for now)

1. heap allocator (unlocks data structures, dynamic arrays lots of nice QOL C++ stuff) 

2. process management (fork() exec(), simple scheduler, memory isolation) this sounds hard asffff but obviously might be the single most important part of an OS

3. filesystem (persistence, reboot wont reset everything, not limited to ram. directories {cd, ls, mkdir}, read/write files {open, read, write , close})

4. compiler. this is the big one and last for a reason. once we have all 4 of these we will be able to compile programs on the OS and basically bootstrap from there
